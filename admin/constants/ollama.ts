 * metric reaches its floor. Everything between them buys precision only, so the
 * default sits at 0.62 rather than at the edge: this corpus is 28 documents and
 * a real ZIM will not score identically, and the two failure modes are not
 * symmetric. A dropped relevant chunk means no answer to a question the corpus
 * *can* answer; an extra irrelevant chunk means noise the model mostly ignores
 * — measured correctness was fine at 0.221 precision. Buy margin, not precision.
 *
 * Note this is a higher cutoff than the same sweep supports on the *semantic*
 * axis, where recall starts falling at 0.60. That gap is the reranker earning
 * its place: it separates relevant from irrelevant better than raw cosine does,
 * so the floor can sit higher without cutting real answers.
 *
 * Note the honest ceiling on the refusal metric: three of the five refusal
 * goldens are tagged `adversarial` and are near-corpus by construction ("what
 * is the TR-88 pump's warranty period?" against a corpus that documents the
 * TR-88 but not its warranty). Retrieving that document is *correct*; declining
 * to answer from it is the generation tier's job, scored by refusalCorrectness.
 * So nonEmptyRateOnRefusal bottoms out at 0.6 here, and a cutoff tuned to drive
 * it lower is cutting real documents.

 * placement — a system message ahead of all history — which changes content
 * every turn and therefore invalidates the cached prefix behind it, making
 * follow-ups progressively slower as the conversation grows.
 *
 * Measured on llama3:8b over a 14-turn conversation (~400-token retrieved block
 * per turn), prefill time for the same prompt:
 *
 *     turn  1    front  214 ms    tail  214 ms
 *     turn  7    front  347 ms    tail  225 ms

 * 2.3x the time-to-first-token, and the gap keeps widening — the familiar
 * "first answer fast, follow-ups get slower" complaint.
 *
 * Caveat worth knowing before trusting this: the saving is proportional to how
 * much of the prompt is *stable*. With a very large retrieved block and a short
 * history the block dominates, must be reprocessed either way, and the two
 * placements measure the same. Tail placement never loses, but it only clearly
 * wins once a conversation has accumulated history — which is exactly when
 * responsiveness starts to matter.
 *
 * Both are kept so `eval:generation` can measure the answer-quality difference
 * rather than the choice resting on the cache argument alone. Flip to 'front'
 * to reproduce pre-change behaviour.

Information has been retrieved from the NOMAD knowledge base for the user's question. It
cleared a relevance filter before reaching you, so it is likely on topic — but it was
selected by automated search, so it may still not contain the specific detail asked for.

[Knowledge Base Context]
${context}

HOW TO ANSWER:
1. When the context contains what was asked for, base your answer on it and answer
   directly and specifically.
2. When it does not, ignore it and answer from your own general knowledge. Do this
   silently — do not mention the knowledge base, the context, or the fact that it lacked
   an answer, and do not apologize.
3. Never narrate your retrieval or reasoning process. Do not write "according to Context 1",
   "the context is unrelated, but", "I couldn't find specific context", or similar. Just
   give the answer as if you simply knew it.
4. Do not fabricate specifics (numbers, names, procedures) that are neither supported by
   the context nor part of your reliable knowledge.

Examples of good suggestions:
- "How do I purify water in an emergency?"
- "What are the best foods for long-term storage?"
- "Help me create a 72-hour emergency kit"

Do NOT use:
- Follow-up questions seeking clarification
- Vague or incomplete suggestions
- Questions that assume prior context
- Statements that are not suggestions themselves, such as praise for asking the question
- Direct questions or commands to the user

You are a query rewriting assistant. Your task is to reformulate the user's latest question to include relevant context from the conversation history.

Given the conversation history, rewrite the user's latest question to be a standalone, context-aware search query that will retrieve the most relevant information.

Rules:
1. Keep the rewritten query concise (under 150 words)
2. Include key entities, topics, and context from previous messages
3. Make it a clear, searchable query
4. Do NOT answer the question - only rewrite the user's query to be more effective for retrieval
5. Respond with JSON: {"queries": ["..."]} — a single rewritten query in the array

Examples:

Conversation:
User: "How do I install Gentoo?"
Assistant: [detailed installation guide]
User: "Is an internet connection required to install?"

Rewritten Query: {"queries": ["Is an internet connection required to install Gentoo Linux?"]}

Conversation:
User: "What's the best way to preserve meat?"
Assistant: [preservation methods]
User: "How long does it last?"

Rewritten Query: {"queries": ["How long does preserved meat last using curing or smoking methods?"]}
