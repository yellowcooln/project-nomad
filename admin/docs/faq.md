# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is NOMAD?
NOMAD is a personal server that gives you access to knowledge, education, and AI assistance without requiring an internet connection. It runs on your own hardware, keeping your data private and accessible anytime.

### Do I need internet to use NOMAD?
No — that's the whole point. Once your content is downloaded, everything works offline. You only need internet to:
- Download new content
- Update the software
- Sync the latest versions of Wikipedia, maps, etc.

### What operating system does NOMAD need?
Debian-based Linux. **Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is what we recommend and test on** for new installs.

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Debian 12 are also supported, so there is no need to reinstall if you are already on one of those. Windows users can follow the [WSL2 guide](https://www.projectnomad.us/install/wsl2), which is community-supported.

macOS and non-Debian distributions like Fedora or Arch are not officially supported. NOMAD does not need a desktop environment, so Ubuntu Server is a fine choice if you are comfortable at the terminal.

For a full walkthrough including the Ubuntu install itself, see the [Installation Guide](https://www.projectnomad.us/install).

### What hardware do I need?
NOMAD is designed for capable hardware, especially if you want to use the AI features. Recommended:
- Modern multi-core CPU (AMD Ryzen 7 with Radeon graphics is the community sweet spot)
- 16GB+ RAM (32GB+ for best AI performance)
- SSD storage (size depends on content — 500GB minimum, 1TB+ recommended)
- NVIDIA or AMD GPU recommended for faster AI responses

**For detailed build recommendations at three price points ($150–$1,000+), see the [Hardware Guide](https://www.projectnomad.us/hardware).**

### How much RAM do I need?

**Without the AI Assistant, the whole stack sits under 1GB.** Measured on a running
install: the Command Center 241MB, MySQL 444MB, Redis 9MB, Kiwix 101MB, and the
knowledge base index 155MB. That is why 4GB is a real minimum rather than a
defensive one.

**The AI is the variable, and it is the model rather than NOMAD.** Ollama idles at
roughly 1.2GB, and a model needs about its download size resident while it answers,
so an 8B model at ~4.6GB wants about that much on top. **8GB is workable for a small
model, 16GB is comfortable, and 32GB is the recommendation if you want to run larger
ones.**

Where that memory comes from depends on your hardware. With a discrete GPU the model
loads into VRAM and never touches system RAM, so VRAM is the number that limits which
models you can run. With an integrated GPU or no GPU at all, it comes out of system
RAM, which is why a CPU-only box needs more of it.

### How much storage do I need?

**To install NOMAD itself: about 5GB, so leave 10GB free.** That covers the
Command Center and its database, before any content. Adding the AI Assistant
brings the total to roughly 25GB, because Ollama and a general-purpose model are
both large.

After that it depends entirely on what you download:
- Full Wikipedia: ~95GB
- Khan Academy courses: ~50GB
- Medical references: ~500MB
- US state maps: ~2-3GB each
- AI models: 10-40GB depending on model

Start with essentials and add more as needed.

## Content Questions

### How do I add more Wikipedia content?
1. Go to **Settings** (hamburger menu → Settings)
2. Click **Content Explorer**
3. Browse available Wikipedia packages
4. Click Download on items you want

You can also use the **Content Explorer** to browse all available ZIM content beyond Wikipedia.

### How do I add more educational courses?
1. Open **Kolibri**
2. Sign in as an admin
3. Go to **Device → Channels**
4. Browse and import available channels

### How current is the content?
Content is as current as when it was last downloaded. Wikipedia snapshots are typically updated monthly. Check the file names or descriptions for dates.

### Can I add my own files?
Yes — with the Knowledge Base. Upload PDFs, text files, and other documents to the [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base), and the AI can reference them when answering your questions. This uses semantic search to find relevant information from your uploaded files.

For Kiwix content, NOMAD uses standard ZIM files. For educational content, Kolibri uses its own channel format.

### What are curated collection tiers?
When selecting content in the Easy Setup wizard or Content Explorer, collections are organized into three tiers:
- **Essential** — Core content for the category (smallest download)
- **Standard** — Essential plus additional useful content
- **Comprehensive** — Everything available for the category (largest download)

This helps you balance content coverage against storage usage.

## AI Questions

### How do I use the AI chat?
1. Go to [AI Chat](/chat) from the Command Center
2. Type your question or request
3. The AI responds in conversational style

The AI must be installed first — enable it during Easy Setup or install it from the [Supply Depot](/supply-depot) page.

### How do I upload documents to the Knowledge Base?
1. Go to **[Knowledge Base →](/knowledge-base)**
2. Upload your documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)
3. Documents are processed and indexed automatically
4. Ask questions in AI Chat — the AI will reference your uploaded documents when relevant

You can also remove documents from the Knowledge Base when they're no longer needed.

NOMAD documentation is automatically added to the Knowledge Base when the AI Assistant is installed.

### What is the System Benchmark?
The System Benchmark tests your hardware performance and generates a NOMAD Score — a weighted composite of CPU, memory, disk, and AI performance. You can create a Builder Tag (a NOMAD-themed identity like "Tactical-Llama-1234") and share your results with the [community leaderboard](https://benchmark.projectnomad.us).

Go to **[System Benchmark →](/settings/benchmark)** to run one.

### What is the Early Access Channel?
The Early Access Channel lets you opt in to receive release candidate builds with the latest features and improvements before they hit stable releases. You can enable or disable it from **Settings → Check for Updates**. Early access builds may contain bugs — if you prefer stability, stay on the stable channel.

## Troubleshooting

### A feature isn't loading or shows a blank page

**Try these steps:**
1. Wait 30 seconds — some features take time to start
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Go back to the Command Center and try again
4. Check Settings → System to see if the service is running
5. Try restarting the service (Stop, then Start in the Supply Depot)

### Maps show a gray/blank area

The Maps feature requires downloaded map data. If you see a blank area:
1. Go to **Settings → Maps Manager**
2. Download map regions for your area
3. Wait for downloads to complete
4. Return to Maps and refresh

### ERROR: Failed to load the XML library file '/data/kiwix-library.xml'

This usually means the Information Library service started before its Kiwix library index was fully initialized.

Try this recovery flow:
1. Go to **[Supply Depot](/supply-depot)**
2. Stop **Information Library (Kiwix)**
3. Wait 10-15 seconds, then start it again
4. If the error persists, run **Force Reinstall** for Information Library from the same page

After restart/reinstall completes, refresh the Information Library page.

### AI responses are slow

Local AI requires significant computing power. To improve speed:
- **Add a GPU** — An NVIDIA GPU with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit can improve AI speed by 10-20x or more
- Close other applications on the server
- Ensure adequate cooling (overheating causes throttling)
- Consider using a smaller/faster AI model if available

### How do I enable GPU acceleration for AI?

NOMAD automatically detects NVIDIA GPUs when the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed on the host system. To set up GPU acceleration:

1. **Install an NVIDIA GPU** in your server (if not already present)
2. **Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit** on the host — follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
3. **Reinstall the AI Assistant** — Go to [Supply Depot](/supply-depot), find AI Assistant, and click **Force Reinstall**

NOMAD will detect the GPU during installation and configure the AI to use it automatically. You'll see "NVIDIA container runtime detected" in the installation progress.

**Tip:** Run a [System Benchmark](/settings/benchmark) before and after to see the difference. GPU-accelerated systems typically see 100+ tokens per second vs 10-15 on CPU only.

### I added/changed my GPU but AI is still slow

When you add or swap a GPU, NOMAD needs to reconfigure the AI container to use it:

1. Make sure the **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** is installed on the host
2. Go to **[Supply Depot](/supply-depot)**
3. Find the **AI Assistant** and click **Force Reinstall**

Force Reinstall recreates the AI container with GPU support enabled. Without this step, the AI continues to run on CPU only.

### I see a "GPU passthrough not working" warning

NOMAD checks whether your GPU is actually accessible inside the AI container. If a GPU is detected on the host but isn't working inside the container, you'll see a warning banner on the System Information and AI Settings pages. Click the **"Fix: Reinstall AI Assistant"** button to recreate the container with proper GPU access. This preserves your downloaded AI models.

### AI Chat not available

The AI Chat page requires the AI Assistant to be installed first:
1. Go to **[Supply Depot](/supply-depot)**
2. Install the **AI Assistant**
3. Wait for the installation to complete
4. The AI Chat will then be accessible from the home screen or [Chat](/chat)

### Knowledge Base upload stuck

If a document upload appears stuck in the Knowledge Base:
1. Check that the AI Assistant is running in **Settings → Supply Depot**
2. Large documents take time to process — wait a few minutes
3. Try uploading a smaller document to verify the system is working
4. Check **Settings → System** for any error messages

### Benchmark won't submit to leaderboard

To share results with the community leaderboard:
- You must run a **Full Benchmark** (not System Only or AI Only)
- The benchmark must include AI results (AI Assistant must be installed and working)
- Your score must be higher than any previous submission from the same hardware

If submission fails, check the error message for details.

### "Service unavailable" or connection errors

The service might still be starting up. Wait 1-2 minutes and try again.

If the problem persists:
1. Go to **Settings → Supply Depot**
2. Find the problematic service
3. Click **Restart**
4. Wait 30 seconds, then try again

### Downloads are stuck or failing

1. Check your internet connection
2. Go to **Settings** and check available storage
3. If storage is full, delete unused content
4. Cancel the stuck download and try again

### The server won't start

If you can't access the Command Center at all:
1. Verify the server hardware is powered on
2. Check network connectivity
3. Try accessing directly via the server's IP address
4. Check server logs if you have console access

### I forgot my Kolibri password

Kolibri passwords are managed separately:
1. If you're an admin, you can reset user passwords in Kolibri's user management
2. If you forgot the admin password, you may need to reset it via command line (contact your administrator)

## Updates and Maintenance

### How do I update NOMAD?
1. Go to **Settings → Check for Updates**
2. If an update is available, click to install
3. The system will download updates and restart automatically
4. This typically takes 2-5 minutes

### Should I update regularly?
Yes, while you have internet access. Updates include:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Security improvements
- Performance enhancements

### Can NOMAD update itself automatically?
Yes. NOMAD can keep its software, its installed apps, and its content current on its own. Automatic updates are **opt-in and off by default** — you turn on what you want from **Settings → Updates** (and, for apps, a per-app toggle in the Supply Depot). They only run inside a time window you choose, after safety checks, and never apply major version jumps automatically. See the **[Updates guide](/docs/updates)** for a full walkthrough.

### How do I update content (Wikipedia, etc.)?
Content updates are separate from software updates:
1. Go to **Settings → Content Manager** or **Content Explorer**
2. Check for newer versions of your installed content
3. Download updated versions as needed

You can also turn on **automatic content updates** so installed Wikipedia/ZIM libraries and map regions refresh on their own overnight — see the [Updates guide](/docs/updates).

Tip: New Wikipedia snapshots are released approximately monthly.

### What happens if an update fails?
The system is designed to recover gracefully. If an update fails:
1. The previous version should continue working
2. Try the update again later
3. Check Settings → System for error messages

### Command-Line Maintenance

For advanced troubleshooting or when you can't access the web interface, NOMAD includes helper scripts in `/opt/project-nomad`:

**Start all services:**
```bash
sudo bash /opt/project-nomad/start_nomad.sh
```

**Stop all services:**
```bash
sudo bash /opt/project-nomad/stop_nomad.sh
```

**Update Command Center:**
```bash
sudo bash /opt/project-nomad/update_nomad.sh
```
*Note: This updates the Command Center only, not individual apps. Update apps through the web interface.*

**Uninstall NOMAD:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad/refs/heads/main/install/uninstall_nomad.sh -o uninstall_nomad.sh
sudo bash uninstall_nomad.sh
```
*Warning: This cannot be undone. All data will be deleted.*

## Privacy and Security

### Is my data private?
Yes. NOMAD runs entirely on your hardware. Your searches, AI conversations, and usage data never leave your server.

### Can others access my server?
By default, NOMAD is accessible on your local network. Anyone on the same network can access it. For public networks, consider additional security measures.

### Does the AI send data anywhere?
No. The AI runs completely locally. Your conversations are not sent to any external service. The AI chat is built into the Command Center — there's no separate service to configure.
