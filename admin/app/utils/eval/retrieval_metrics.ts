 *
 * Retrieval returns *chunks*, but a golden answer lives in a *document*. The
 * two questions we care about are different, so they are measured differently:
 *
 * - **Document level** (recall, MRR, nDCG): "did the answer's document make it
 *   into the context at all, and how near the top?" Chunks are collapsed to
 *   their document, keeping each document's best rank.
 * - **Chunk level** (precision): "how much of what we injected is noise?" This
 *   is deliberately *not* deduped — five chunks from one irrelevant document
 *   cost five slots of a small model's context and should be counted five
 *   times.
 *
 * Reporting only one of these hides a real failure mode in the other.

 * - the **final** score is what reranking and source diversity produced, and it

 *
 * Reranking's boosts are score-scaled and additive (up to ~1.275x), so the two
 * distributions sit at different heights. Calibrating one cutoff against the
 * other axis' percentiles is off by exactly that factor, which is why both are
 * reported separately rather than collapsed into one number.
